## 🤖 Spring AI – Bringing AI Magic to Your Spring Apps

Ever wanted to sprinkle some AI magic into your Spring applications without losing your sanity? Well, say hello to **Spring AI** – your AI-powered sidekick that makes working with LLMs (Large Language Models) a breeze! 🚀 Inspired by **LangChain4j** and **LlamaIndex**, Spring AI helps you seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into your existing or new Spring projects.

Much like **JdbcTemplate** or **RestClient**, Spring AI hides all the mind-numbing complexities of dealing with LLMs from top vendors like **OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Hugging Face**. You focus on coding; Spring AI does the heavy lifting! 💪

## 🛠️ How Does It Work?

Spring AI provides high-level interfaces like:

- **ChatModel** – Because talking to AI should be fun!
- **ImageModel** – AI-generated images? Yes, please! 🎨
- **VectorStore** – Storing AI knowledge like a pro!

Each module is tailored to work with specific LLMs, and you can import only what you need. No AI bloatware here! 😎
